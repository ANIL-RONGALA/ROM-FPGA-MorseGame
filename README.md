# ROM-Based Morse Code Challenge on FPGA
An interactive Morse Code Challenge game implemented on the Intel Cyclone V (5CEBA4F23C7N) using Verilog and Quartus Prime. Features include multi-user authentication with secure login via EPCS64 flash, time-limited levels with progressive difficulty, real-time score tracking using RAM, and modular, scalable architecture. Simulated and verified using ModelSim with comprehensive testbenches for ROM, RAM, timing, and authentication modules.
